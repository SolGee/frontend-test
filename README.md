# Frontend-test

## About

This is an open ended test, while we request a few features how you go about solving them is up to you. The goal here is for you to show us some of your skills and know-how in react. 

## Goals

- Set up a green field project using react and redux (preferably, you can use other libraries but you should explain your reasons behind your decisions)
- Get information from an open api
  - We recommend using something like the [Pokemon Api](https://pokeapi.co/).
- Store your information in redux.
- Use the redux state to build a list of items
- Allow us to load more items and delete items from the list using hooks.
- Make it pretty
  - Feel free to use SASS or styled-components to style the application

## Notes

- Use best practices for react, and build your project as if you were to scale it.
  - We use [Airbnb Style Guide](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript)
- Explain how you would improve the application and future plans.
- If you weren't able to finish all the goals of the project, how would you go out exucuting them?
- Explain your thoughts on the project you built, the Architecture of the folders, how you built the pages, and elements, ect.
